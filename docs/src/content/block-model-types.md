# Block model types

`blockModelType` values are available through polymer and limited in number, since they re-use block-states that are visually the same on the client.

The following options are availble, with their amount:

blockModelType | Amount of blocks
---|---
full_block | 1149
transparent_block | 52
transparent_block_waterlogged | 52
biome_transparent_block | 78
biome_transparent_block_waterlogged | 65
farmland_block | 5
vines_block | 100
plant_block | 7
biome_plant_block | 15
kelp_block | 25
cactus_block | 15
tripwire_block | 32
tripwire_block_flat | 32
top_slab | 5
top_slab_waterlogged | 5
bottom_slab | 5
bottom_slab_waterlogged | 5


When choosing blocks that break instantly on the client, like plant blocks, the destroyTime property in the block config has to be 0 as well.

You can map the `blockModelType` field of block configs to blockstates, this allows you to change the hitbox of the block depending on the block-state.

In some cases, for example when using the `simple_waterloggable` behaviour, you might want to specify the waterlogged state for your custom block.

Example:
```json
{
  "id": "mynamespace:half_slab",
  "blockResource": {
    "models" : {
      "waterlogged=false": "minecraft:custom/block/dirt/dirt_slab",
      "waterlogged=true": "minecraft:custom/block/dirt/dirt_slab"
    }
  },
  "itemResource": {
    "models" : {
      "default": "minecraft:custom/block/dirt/dirt_slab"
    }
  },
  "behaviour": {
    "simple_waterloggable": {}
  },
  "blockModelType": {
    "waterlogged=false": "sculk_sensor_block",
    "waterlogged=true": "sculk_sensor_block_waterlogged"
  },
  "properties": {
    "blockBase": "minecraft:dirt"
  }
}
```
