## Creating a cosmetic

Using the cosmetic behaviour (+ equippable component in 1.21.2) you can create wearable cosmetics (animated too!) that rotate with the players body.

For normal hats, the `minecraft:equippable` should be enough.

You can also use the `filament:skin` component to make your cosmetic a skin for other items like helmets.
